# How to Restore

Please note that we are not responsible for any data or economic loss caused by your use of this project.

## Peek

You can use the script to restore your site from backup.

The script file is located at `./scripts/restore.sh`.

## Usage

The script needs to be run with root privileges, so use `sudo ./scripts/backup.sh`.
You need to create a folder named `restore` in the project path.

```bash
cd wply
mkdir restore
```

Next, put the backup files generated by the backup script into this folder, and then run the script.

```bash
cp site_backup/timestamp/* restore/
./scripts/restore.sh
```

## Warning

- This script will delete the current database files and your database will be cleared for restoration.
- Docker volumes may not be cleared by this script, but files in the corresponding Docker volumes will be overwritten.
- The database will be briefly offline and will restart several times.
