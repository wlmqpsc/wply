# Import Website

You can use `restore.sh` the restore script for site import.

## Prepare Files

You need to use `tar` to make a compressed backup of the files of the existing site in the following directories, and rename them to the corresponding names:

| File Name                         | Directories                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| wply_wordpress_backup.tar.gz      | WordPress Directory                      |
| wply_phpmyadmin_backup.tar.gz     | phpMyadmin Directory                     |
| wply_lychee_config_backup.tar.gz  | lychee config Directory                  |
| wply_lychee_sym_backup.tar.gz     | lychee sym Directory                     |
| wply_lychee_uploads_backup.tar.gz | lychee uploads Directory                 |
| wply_certbot_cert_backup.tar.gz   | certbot Cert Directory                   |
| mariadb_backup.tar.gz             | mariadb backup Generated database backup |

All files are optional, if you don't have the above directories, for example if you haven't used Lychee before then you can optionally create these `.tar.gz` files.

## Database

You can use `mariabackup` to create physical backups and restore them using scripts or the command line.  
You can also use `mariadb-dump` to get a logical backup, and then use the command line to restore.  
If you previously installed phpMyadmin, you can also use it to create logical backups. Finally, restore through phpMyadmin in the new site.

## Restore

Refer to the *How to Restore* documentation and run the script to restore.
